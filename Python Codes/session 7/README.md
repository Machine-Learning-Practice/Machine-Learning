# SVM

In this session, we will train models with SVM using different hyperparameters. We will also slighly talk about how to compare different models with their accuracy scores.

## Contents
- SVM with linear kernel
- SVM with rbf kernel
- SVM with sigmoid kernel
- SVM with polynomial kernel
- Compare models with accuracy scores.

## Getting Started
To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
As an alternative way, you can use google colab. It's free and efficient. [official google colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Usage
You can use this repository to learn about the Machine Learning. Simply go through the code and comments in the files to understand how they work.
