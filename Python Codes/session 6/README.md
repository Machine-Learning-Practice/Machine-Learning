# Logistic Regression

In this session, we will train a logistic regression model. At the end, we will do this again with scikit-learn library once more.

## Contents
- logistic regression cost
- logistic regression gradient descent
- train a model with logistic regression
- train a model with logistic regression using sklearn

## Getting Started
To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
As an alternative way, you can use google colab. It's free and efficient. [official google colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/)
