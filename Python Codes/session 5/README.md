# Multi-variable Linear Regression

In this session, we will train a multi-variable linear regression model. Then, we will emphasize the importance of the learning rate tuning. After that, we will introduce feature scaling and we will show that without proper feature scaling we will get some convergence issues. At the end, we will introduce scikit-learn library that is a popular data science and mahcine learning library to train our multi-variable model once more.

## Getting Started
To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
As an alternative way, you can use google colab. It's free and efficient. [official google colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Usage
You can use this repository to learn about the Machine Learning. Simply go through the code and comments in the files to understand how they work.
